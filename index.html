       <h1>Independent Project Proposal - Ella Ferrin</h1>
       <h2>Project Name</h2>
            <p>Fun Places Website Overhaul</p>
       <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For my independent project, I am going to be creating a website for my mom’s small business, Fun Places. My mom, Danielle, designs and paints murals in public spaces, like elementary and secondary schools, dentist and doctors' offices, churches and more! Currently, she doesn’t have a website and the only online presence her company has is a Facebook page where she uploads images of her project. While this is good for showcasing the visuals of her previous work, it doesn’t really tell the whole story about her brand. For this reason, I will be designing a Squarespace website for her after conducting competitor and user research to determine how best to design the site. </p>
       <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Conduct competitor and user research to understand the mural and art market as it relates to online content and promotion</li>
                <li>Establish a cohesive story about Fun Places that is well told through a Squarespace site</li>
                <li>Showcase past murals and projects for fans and potential clients to view</li>
                <li>Create a straightforward website that is well-designed, as free of unintentional bias as possible and accessible to all users of the web</li>
            </ol>
       <h2>Audience</h2>

                    <li><b>Frustrations/Pain Points:</b>Websites that are difficult to navigate, lack of centralization of artists’ pieces of work, no easy way to reshare work to social media or personal storage </li>
